# Airbnb

Notebooks are named after every city considered in the Project.

The results of the project are stored in the attached presentation.

The project was inspired by a set of kernels published on kaggle.com.
The main idea is to find a city in Europe, to invest a certain amount of money (5 million Eur) in apartments, which are supposed to be rented on the Airbnb platform.

The only criterion here is a return rate from the investment.
The project shall indicate not only in which city apartments shall be purchased, but also the best neighborhoods, type of apartment, and many other factors.
